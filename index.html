      <h2>What is happening now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned?
</h2>
        <p>
         This decision will have enormous consequences for pregnant people across the United States, who will now find it extremely difficult, and in many cases impossible,to get the care they want and need for safe abortions. With 26 states being likely to ban abortions, it has become even harder for low income people to get abortions. </p> <p class="attribution"> To learn more about how this will affect women <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn">click here</a> <class="attribution"> and
